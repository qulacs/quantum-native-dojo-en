    "# chapter 7 Quantum phase estimation algorithm and its application\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 7 describes the quantum phase estimation algorithm, one of the most important quantum algorithms, and the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, which uses it as a subroutine to solve simultaneous linear equations at high speed (quantum phase estimation algorithm itself has already been briefly introduced in Section [2-4](2.4_phase_estimation_beginner.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, we introduce quantum random access memory (qRAM), which is required when applying the HHL algorithm to a real problem, and an example of applying the HHL algorithm to the financial engineering problem of portfolio optimization. The contents of this chapter are expected to be applied to a wide range of fields, such as speeding up machine learning using quantum computers and high-precision energy calculations for large-scale molecules. I would like you to broaden your interest while referring to references.\n",
    "(Algorithms introduced in this chapter are long-term algorithms (algorithms that will only work on quantum computers with quantum error correction).)"
