    "In this section, you will learn about a quantum algorithm called **\"phase estimation algorithm\"**, which is very important for future applications of quantum computers. Phase estimation algorithm is used to estimate the eigenvalues of a unitary matrix.

    "As in [section 2-2](2.2_Hadamard_test.ipynb), consider the problem of estimating the eigenvalue $e^{i\\lambda}$ of the unitary operation $U$. In the Hadamard test, the eigenvalue phase $\\lambda$ was reflected in the probability distribution of the test measurement results, and $\\lambda$ was estimated by sampling many measurement results. Let's see how we can improve this a little more to extract the phase information more directly from the measurement results."

    "\n",
    "An important application of phase estimation is the prime factorization algorithm.\n",
    "The prime factorization problem is to find a non-1 divisor of $N$ given an $n$-digit integer $N$.\n",
    "The problem is to find the divisor of $N$ that is not 1, given an $n$-digit integer $N$, and no conventional computer algorithm which can solve this problem in polynomial has been found. The computational cost of the current best algorithm is\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "O\\left(\\exp \\left[\\frac{64}{9} n (\\log n )^2 \\right]^{1/3}\\right)\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "and takes quasi-exponential computation time.\n",
    "RSA ciphers and other cryptosystems that take advantage of the difficulty of such prime factorization problems are also used in everyday life.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1994, P. Shor proved that the prime factorization problem can be solved in polynomial time for $n$ digits by using a quantum computer. This is the so-called Shor's prime factorization algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $N$ be an integer to be prime factorized. First, find an integer $x$ that is prime to $N$.\n",
    "($x$ can be easily found by Euclid's reciprocal division method.\n",
    "Take $x$ at random, and calculate the greatest common divisor of $N$ and $x$ by Euclid's reciprocal division.\n",
    "If it is an integer other than 1, you have found a nontrivial divisor of $N$ and the (prime) factorization is complete.\n",
    "If it is only 1, then $x$ is an integer that is prime to $N$.)\n",
    "In this case, let us consider the rank $r$ of $x$ with respect to $N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rank $r$ is the smallest integer satisfying\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "x^r \\equiv 1 \\textrm{ (mod $N$)}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    ", and it is known that $r$ will be even with high probability if $x$ is chosen at random.\n",
    "If $r$ is even, the above equation can be transformed as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "(x^{r/2} + 1) (x^{r/2} - 1)  \\equiv 0  \\textrm{ (mod $N$)}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that either $x^{r/2} \\pm 1 \\equiv 0 \\: (\\textrm{mod} \\: N)$ or \n",
    "$x^{r/2} + 1$ and $x^{r/2} - 1$ have nontrivial commutations with $N$ (**factor** of $N$).\n",
    "In fact, we can also show that when $x$ is chosen at random, the probability of the latter is high enough. Therefore, by using Euclid's reciprocal division of the common divisor between $x^{r/2} + 1$ or $x^{r/2} - 1$ and $N$, we can eventually find a nontrivial factor of $N$.\n",
    "By repeating this process, $N$ can be decomposed into smaller and smaller factors, and finally prime factorization can be achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the key rank $r$ of the prime factorization can be determined by finding the eigenvalues of the unitary matrix corresponding to the classical calculation of multiplying the input $Y$ by $X$ under mod $N$\n",
    "\n",

    "U_x = \\sum _y |yx \\: \\textrm{mod} \\: N)\\rangle \\langle y|\n",
    "$$\n",

    "Indeed, using the eigenstate labels $0 \\leq s \\leq r-1$, the eigenvectors can be written down as\n",

    "$$\n",
    "U_x |u_s \\rangle =  e^{2 \\pi i (s/r)} |u_s \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, from the phase estimate of the eigenvalues of $U_x$, $s/r$ can be obtained ,and $r$ as its denominator (and from that rank $r$, $N$ can be prime factorized by the above procedure).\n",
    "This is the so-called prime factorization algorithm by Shore (a version using Kitaev's phase estimate).\n",

    "1. prime factorization problem: As we saw in the column above, the phase estimation algorithm can be used to estimate a number called the rank, which can be used to perform prime factorization.\n",
    "2. energy calculation for quantum systems: In quantum mechanics, energy is given by the eigenvalues of a matrix called the Hamiltonian. The energy of the most stable state is given by the smallest eigenvalue, and the stable state by the corresponding eigenvector. Although the Hamiltonian itself is not a unitary matrix, the energy can be calculated by performing a phase estimate on the unitary matrix $e^{-i H t}$ defined by the exponential function of the matrix, which corresponds to the time evolution ([Section 7-1](7.1_quantum_phase_estimation_detailed.ipynb)) .\n",
    "3. solving a simultaneous linear equation $Ax=b$: Using eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained by phase estimation, the solution to the simultaneous linear equation can be obtained ([Section 7-2](7.2_Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd_algorithm.ipynb)). Its application to machine learning has also been studied."
