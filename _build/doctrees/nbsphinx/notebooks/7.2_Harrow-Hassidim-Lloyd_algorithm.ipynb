    "## 7-2. Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) Algorithm\n",
    "In this section, we introduce the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm, one of the most important applications of the quantum phase estimation algorithm, which is a fast \"solving\" algorithm for (sparse) simultaneous linear equations. It has attracted a great deal of attention because simultaneous linear equations are used in all kinds of scientific and engineering calculations, including electromagnetic, thermal, and fluid analysis, machine learning, and so on.\n",

    "### Problem Setup\n",
    "The HHL algorithm efficiently \"computes\" the solution $\\mathbf{x}=A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$　of the linear system $A\\mathbf{x}=\\mathbf{b}$ for a sparse, regular $N \\times N$ matrix $A$ and an $N$-dimensional vector $\\bf{b}$. (In this section, vectors are denoted by **bold**):.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "|\\mathbf{b} \\rangle \\xrightarrow{\\text{HHL}} | A^{-1}\\mathbf{b} \\rangle.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let me explain what this equation means. First, the state $|\\mathbf{x}\\rangle, |\\mathbf{b}\\rangle$ with a vector in the ket is defined as follows:.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "|\\mathbf{x}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_i x_i |i \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\sum_i |x_i|^2}},  |\\mathbf{b}\\rangle = \\frac{\\sum_i b_i |i \\rangle}{\\sqrt{\\sum_i |b_i|^2}},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x_i, b_i$ are the $i=0,1,\\ldots, N-1$-th component of the vector and $|i\\rangle$ is the computational basis corresponding to the binary representation of $i$ (for example, $|5\\rangle = |0\\cdots0101\\rangle$). To represent a vector of $N$ components, we only need $\\log_2 N$ qubits.\n",
    "The HHL algorithm is an algorithm that uses the quantum phase estimation algorithm and auxiliary bits to quickly and accurately create a solution state $|A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}\\rangle$ from the input state $|\\mathbf{b}\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A detailed description of the computational complexity is given at the end of this section, but the HHL algorithm can perform the above transformation with a computational complexity of $O(\\text{poly}(\\log N))$, or about $\\log N$ polynomials. The computational complexity of the current best classical algorithm for a similar calculation is $O(N)$, so the HHL algorithm achieves exponential acceleration.\n",
    "However, there are some important **cautions**:.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The matrix $A$ must be SPARSE. Specifically, the number of nonzero components in each row must be $O(\\text{poly}(\\log N))$.\n",
    "- From the given classical data $\\mathbf{b}$, it is not easy in general to prepare the state $|\\mathbf{b}\\rangle$ on a quantum computer, and input could cost $O(N)$ of computation. The above $O(\\text{poly}(\\log N))$ is based on the assumption that the state $|\\mathbf{b}\\rangle$ is available. In [Column: Quantum Random Access Memory (qRAM)](7.2c_quantum_random_access_memory.ipynb), this point is explained in a little more depth.\n",
    "- Reading out the output solution state $| A^{-1}\\mathbf{b} \\rangle$ as the classical vector $A^{-1}\\mathbf{b}$ also takes $O(N)$ of time, and the exponential acceleration is offset."

However, one or more auxiliary bits are required for each irreversible gate such as NAND in a classical circuit, and a significant number of auxiliary bits are needed just to perform this arithmetic.\n",
