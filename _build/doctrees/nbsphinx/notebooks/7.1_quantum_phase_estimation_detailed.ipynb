    "Let us recall the transformation of QPE specifically. Let $| u_i \\rangle$ be the eigenvector corresponding to the $i$-th eigenvalue $e^{i \\lambda_i}$ of $U$ ($U | u_i \\rangle = e^{i \\lambda_i} | u_i \\rangle$). At this time, using the control unitary operation $\\Lambda (U)$ and the quantum Fourier transform, the QPE realizes the following transform.\n",

That is, $ U = e^{-iH\\tau}$ (where $\\tau$ is a constant). Therefore, the large power of $U$ means simulating development of $H$ for a long time (exponential to the reciprocal of precision) which is very difficult."

That is, exponentially more gates must be used to improve accuracy. Here, we introduced a method based on a simple Trotter decomposition, there have been many studies using other methods to efficiently implement the time evolution operator. Interested readers are referred to references [4][5][6]."
